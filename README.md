# Brainfudge
Brainfudge is a brainfuck interpreter written in C++.

***Note: if you have a better name feel free to suggest***

**Brainfuck** is a simple language written by Ürban Muller. it is a esoteric programming language, meaning it's very minimalistic. The language is really hard and not practical, hence the name brainfuck, but it is fun coding with it. 
I saw many interpreters like <a href="copy.sh/brainfuck">El Brainfuck</a> a really cool one and others. I will probably mention them under.

But these interpreters are useless when we don't have Internet access, but this interpreter you just need the internet once, and then it's useable everytime.

the language only contains 8 valid characters **[ ] > < + - . ,** other characters 
will be ignore as comments. I added new characters, more like control-characters, 
like halts & comments & snapshot tokens.

# Online Brainfuck interpreters 

As i said, there are many interpreters online, one of which and my favourite. 
**<a href="copy.sh/brainfuck">El Brainfuck</a>**. 
But when trying to find the best interpreter, I encountered many. Like:
